## Scene 0:
The host and Chacer are talking to each other while Chaucer was riding an old lean, bony, and sorry horse but that does not hinder him from telling him a merry story.

## Scene 1: 
Once there was a poor widow who lived in a humble cottage by a wood-side in a valley. She was an honest old woman, and ever since the death of her husband, she had been living with her only 2 daughters. After the death of her husband, the widow had to work hard and cheerfully to support herself and her only 2 daughters. She had a small piece of land where she could produce food from their farm. She had 3 fat pigs, 3 cows, and a sheep, called Mally. She also had a rooster, called Chanticleer, and a hen, called Pertelote. The widow loved her animals and took good care of them, especially Chanticleer. 

## Scene 2: 
There was only 2 rooms in her cottage, one to sleep in and one to have meals in, and both of the rooms were black with soot, for there was no proper fireplace in her cottage, and the smoke from the fire would fill the rooms. The widow had to cook in the kitchen, which was outside of her cottage, and the kitchen was also black with soot. The widow had to go to the kitchen to cook every day, and she had to go through the yard where her animals were kept. 

## Scene 3: 
The pigs produced bacon, the cows produced milk, and the sheep produced wool. The widow would sell the bacon, milk, and wool in the market to earn money to support her family.

## Scene 4:
Chanticleer lived in the yard of widow, and the yard was a dry and dusty place, and there was no grass in the yard. The yard was surrounded by a wooden fence, and there was a gate to enter the yard. The gate was always open, and the animals could go in and out of the yard freely.

## Scene 5:
Chanticleer was very buituful and proud of his feathers, and he would often strut around the yard to show off his feathers. He would crow loudly in the morning to wake up the widow and her daughters, and he would crow again in the evening to signal the end of the day.

## Scene 6:
Every morning Chanticleer would struck on the horizon and would crow loudly to wake up the widow and her daughters, and every evening he would crow again to signal the end of the day. The widow and her daughters would always thank Chanticleer for waking them up and for signaling the end of the day.
