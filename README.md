Scene 0:
The host and Chacer are talking to each other while Chaucer was riding an old lean, bony, and sorry horse but that does not hinder him from telling him a merry story.
Scene 1: 
Once there was a poor widow who lived in a humble cottage by a wood-side in a valley. She was an honest old woman, and ever since the death of her husband, she had been living with her only 2 daughters. After the death of her husband, the widow had to work hard and cheerfully to support herself and her only 2 daughters. She had a small piece of land where she could produce food from their farm. She had 3 fat pigs, 3 cows, and a sheep, called Mally. She also had a rooster, called Chanticleer, and a hen, called Pertelote. The widow loved her animals and took good care of them, especially Chanticleer. 
Scene 2: 
Caucher narrating the story of Chanticleer and Pertelote, with illustrations of the rooster and hen in the background. The pilgrims are shown reacting to the story, with some laughing and others looking surprised.
Scene 3:
