## Scene 0:
The host and Chacer are talking to each other while Chaucer was riding an old lean, bony, and sorry horse but that does not hinder him from telling him a merry story.

## Scene 1: 
Once there was a poor widow who lived in a humble cottage by a wood-side in a valley. She was an honest old woman, and ever since the death of her husband, she had been living with her only 2 daughters. After the death of her husband, the widow had to work hard and cheerfully to support herself and her only 2 daughters. She had a small piece of land where she could produce food from their farm. She had 3 fat pigs, 3 cows, and a sheep, called Mally. She also had a rooster, called Chanticleer, and a hen, called Pertelote. The widow loved her animals and took good care of them, especially Chanticleer. 

## Scene 2: 
There was only 2 rooms in her cottage, one to sleep in and one to have meals in, and both of the rooms were black with soot, for there was no proper fireplace in her cottage, and the smoke from the fire would fill the rooms. The widow had to cook in the kitchen, which was outside of her cottage, and the kitchen was also black with soot. The widow had to go to the kitchen to cook every day, and she had to go through the yard where her animals were kept. 

## Scene 3: 
The pigs produced bacon, the cows produced milk, and the sheep produced wool. The widow would sell the bacon, milk, and wool in the market to earn money to support her family.

## Scene 4:
Chanticleer lived in the yard of widow, and the yard was a dry and dusty place, and there was no grass in the yard. The yard was surrounded by a wooden fence, and there was a gate to enter the yard. The gate was always open, and the animals could go in and out of the yard freely.

## Scene 5:
Chanticleer was very beautiful and proud of his feathers. His comb was redder than the reddest coral, and indented like the leaves of a tree. His wattles were redder than the reddest coral, and his beak was sharper than the sharpest knife. He had a long neck, and his legs were long and slender. 

## Scene 6:
Every morning Chanticleer would struck on the horizon and would crow loudly to wake up the widow and her daughters, and every evening he would crow again to signal the end of the day. The widow and her daughters would always thank Chanticleer for waking them up and for signaling the end of the day.

## Scene 7:
Chanticleer has 7 hens, and he loved them very much. He would always take care of them and protect them from any danger. He would always crow loudly to warn them if there was any danger nearby. The hens would always thank Chanticleer for taking care of them and for warning them about any danger.

## Scene 8:
Chanticleer also had lady-loves, and they were nearly as pretty as his own feathers, but the fairest of all of them was Dame Partlet. Dame Partlet was polite, sociable, and had altogether such a good air about herself ever since she was a week old. Chanticleer had quite lost his heart to Dame Partlet, and he would always crow loudly to show his love for her. Dame Partlet would always thank Chanticleer for showing his love for her and for being such a good rooster.

## Scene 9:
